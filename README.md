# OCC_ML_Project
One Class Classification and Outlier Detection ML Project 2020

In many application domains, machine learning techniques can be used to check whether the considered datapoints are ”normal” in the sense that they follow the common distribution of the rest of the data. The focus of this project is to study techniques that allow to learn anomaly/novelty detection model from ”normal” data only (and not as a simple binary classification problem which is only possible when sufficiently many anomalies exists and are labelled as such).
